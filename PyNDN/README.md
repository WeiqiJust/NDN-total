PyNDN: A Named Data Networking client library with TLV wire format support in native Python
===========================================================================================

PyNDN 2.0 is a new implementation of a Named Data Networking client library written in pure Python.
It is wire format compatible with the new NDN-TLV encoding, with ndnd-tlv and NFD.

See the file [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/named-data/PyNDN2/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
for instructions to build and run from the full distribution.

If you only need to install the pyndn Python module, you can use easy_install.
(If you don't have easy_install, see the instructions at
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#installation-instructions .)
In a terminal, enter:

    sudo CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments easy_install pyndn

This installs the pyndn module on the Python search path so that applications
which depend on it can use it, but does not install the sample tests or documentation
files. If you need these other files, then use the full distribution and see the INSTALL.md file.

Please submit any bugs or issues to the PyNDN issue tracker:

The library currently requires a remote NDN daemon, and has been tested with ndnd-tlv, from
the NDN-TLV package: https://github.com/named-data/ndnd-tlv and with NFD from the package
https://github.com/named-data/NFD .

The API follows the NDN Common Client Library API also used by ndn-cpp (C++) and ndn-js (JavaScript).
See http://named-data.net/doc/ndn-ccl-api .

Since PyNDN 2.0 conforms to the new Common Client Library API, applications written in the pre-2.0 version
of PyNDN need to be upgraded.
